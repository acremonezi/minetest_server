# Minetest‚Å† Server
This Server was implemented with Docker and Postgres.  


## Purpose
I created this project with the goal of helping parents to easily create a reliable and stable Minetest Server.

And therefore, offer to their children a private and safe game environment that you can build at home on your local network for instance.
<br> So kids can unleash their imagination and creativity and then create and carry out their build projects.

Because I believe that Technology is a way to serve people.


## Minetest
It is a near-infinite-world block sandbox game and a game engine, inspired by InfiniMiner, Minecraft, and similars.<br>
